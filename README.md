# Flashbang ðŸ’¥

NFT sniper bot that takes out flashloans to buy NFTs listed under the price of an existing offer, then accepting the offer and closing the loan.

F#%$ you OpenSea, give me an API key.

Currently building this with the LooksRare API, but don't know how to build MakerOrder objects to match to my Taker Bid(s).

If you know how to do this, and make a pull request with the solution, I'll give you 0.1 ETH.
